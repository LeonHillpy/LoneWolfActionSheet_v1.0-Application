# LoneWolfActionSheet_v1.1-Application

This is an unofficial action sheet desktop application for the Lone Wolf books. This application is not an official product of Lone Wolf/Magnamund.com/Holmgard Press. permission to post this application to Github has been given by Holmgard Press on 27th November 2024.

This desktop application acts as a digital action chart for the Lone Wolf books. The action chart can be saved with the save sheet button, which is in .csv format and will be located in "SavedSheets" folder within the directory. The most recent file is loaded with the load sheet button. The saved .csv file is named as the time and day at which it is saved. It is always the mose recent .csv file that is loaded, so if you wish to load an older file for whatever reason that may be, make sure it is the only file in "SavedSheets" folder.

At the moment this is a finished piece of software, however the next change could be to add more entries to accomodate the later books. And to also automate the combat by having the dice roll paired with battle ratio to automatically reduce endurance points from both Lone Wolf and Enemy.

As mentioned above, combat is not yet automated but this could be a feature to add at a later date. But for now, the combat window will generate the battle ratio after the user has entered the enemy combat score. The combat window has a working 0 - 9 dice roll.
